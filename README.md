# Aquarover-STM32
# Aquarover Surface-Driving Robot using STM32

## Overview

The Aquarover Surface-Driving Robot is a floating robotic system designed to move across the water surface. The robot is controlled using an STM32 microcontroller and allows manual control using a joystick 
This project was completed during the Aquarover Workshop at DeepTech Club and demonstrates embedded systems, motor control, and PCB design skills.

## Hardware Components

- STM32 Blue Pill Microcontroller
- Thruster DC Motors
- Servo Motor
- L298N Motor Driver
- Joystick Module
- Potentiometers
- Step-Down Converter (5V)
- Battery and Power Module

- Connecting Wires

---

## Software Tools

- STM32CubeIDE
- Embedded C Language
- STM32 HAL Libraries

---

## System Operation

- Joystick provides analog input
- STM32 reads input using ADC
- STM32 generates PWM signals
- Motor driver controls thruster motors
- Robot moves forward, backward, left, and right on water surface

---

## Hardware Implementation

The complete circuit was soldered on a perfboard (donut board) to ensure stable and reliable operation.

---

## PCB Design

A custom PCB was designed using KiCad to demonstrate professional circuit layout.  
However, the PCB was not fabricated.

---

## Results

- Robot successfully moved on water surface
- Smooth and accurate motor control
- Stable hardware operation
- Successful integration of embedded system and motor control

---

## Future Improvements

- Add wireless control (Bluetooth / WiFi)
- Manufacture PCB
- Add autonomous navigation
- Add sensors for obstacle detection
